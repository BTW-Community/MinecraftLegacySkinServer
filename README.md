# Minecraft Legacy Skin Server

This application allows you to run a local server that you can either add to your hosts file or use with Better Than Wolves' config setting. I also released a mod for 1.5.2 that fixes the issue altogether.

# How to use the mod

Simply install into the jar

# How to use the server

Note that capes currently don't work in the server version, they do work in the mod version

Redirect 'skins.minecraft.net' in your hosts file to 'localhost:5444' 

OR use the Better Than Wolves config and set the following:
```
fcPlayerSkinURL=http://localhost:5444/MinecraftSkins/
```

Now run the server and then open the game. Enjoy!
